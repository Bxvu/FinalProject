# FinalProject
Final Project for school

'''
**********Gameplay ideas:
shoot carrots up at enemy,
shoot carrots left and right,
platforms that change as you get a higher score,
enemy that goes down instead of left and right,
enemies shoot left right and down,
enemies move faster and in larger areas as score gets higher,
new power ups,
carrot upgrades as you pick up more,
shield powerup that blocks one enemy attack,

**********Bugs
when you get launched by powerup or head jump player sometimes snaps to platform abruptly 
happens when hitting jump during power up boost,
random "ghost" enemy that is not affected by anything and can't kill player with its attacks

**********Gameplay fixes
getting killed while being boosted,

**********Features
upgrades for shooting carrots at enemies,
enemies shoot stuff,
picking up carrots lets you shoot more at once,
if you have more than 3 carrots, you lose the carrots instead of dying,
shield powerup,
platforms and decorations on them change with higher scores
